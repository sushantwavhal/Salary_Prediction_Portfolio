# Salary Prediction Portfolio

## DEFINE THE PROBLEM
For this Salary prediction portfolio I chose to examine 1 million job records along with their features such as **Job Type, Major, Degree, Industry, Years of Experience, Distance from the metropolis area** and the given **SALARY**. Based on this data, I'm going to build some predictive models and choose the best model (having lowest MSE) and use it to predict salaries of another 1 million jobs based on their features.

### PROJECT OUTLINE:

- Load the data, Understand the data, Find relationships between attributes
- Establish a baseline model, Engineer features, Optimize the data features
- Select the best model with the lowest Evaluation metric and
- **Predict salaries of another 1 million job features using the selected model**
